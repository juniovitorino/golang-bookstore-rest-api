# Go, Gin, Gorm REST API Bookstore Example

An improved version of the code generated by the tutorial [REST API with Golang using Gin and Gorm](https://blog.logrocket.com/rest-api-golang-gin-gorm/).

## Improvements

- Hot Reload with [Air](https://github.com/cosmtrek/air);
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) instead of SQLite;
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/);
- UUID on primary keys;
- [GORM](https://gorm.io/) Model (createdAt, updatedAt, deletedAt);
- [Procfile](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/procfile) (I like [Foreman](https://ddollar.github.io/foreman/) to manage processes);
